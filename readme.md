A virtual assistant that helps you remember people that you know and things you have to do by providing non-invasive cues through an intelligent voice interface.

# How I built it
I used a *Flask app* as the back end, and an *Angular app* as the front end. I used the *Microsoft Azure Face API* for facial recognition as well as an abundance of *Google Cloud Platform services* to support our application: including *Google Compute Engine, Google App Engine, Firebase Realtime Database, Google Cloud Storage, and Google Cloud Text-to-Speech*.

*Note*

Right now the database is not populated well, but it is fairly easy to populate the database with more people if you go into the backend loadDatabase.py file and edit accordingly.
